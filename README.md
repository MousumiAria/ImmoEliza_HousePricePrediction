## The timeline of the project: 
**27/04/2022 - 05/05/2022**

## Duration: 
* 6 days

## Dataset details:
* DataSets used by scrapping datas from the real estate company "ImmoEliza" in Belgium. The datasets contained approx(~10,000) house details including information like locality, type of property, price, area, no. of rooms, no. of bathrooms etc.

## Description:

ImmoEliza_HousePricePrediction is an interactive application to predict house prices based on several features like Surface area, Number of Bed Rooms, Attic, Terrace, Swimming Pool etc. With this App the user can provide their preferred features and gets an estimated price of the house. The following procedures have been followed for building the application.

1.  Data Cleaning: The scrapped data received in a csv file format is cleaned first by eradicating duplicate, missing data and null values
using Python, Pandas and Numpy.

2.  Data visualization: The cleaned data is further used in Jupyter notebook to visualize and to identify 
the important features which have the most effect on determining the house prices. 

3. Model Selection: Here Linear regression machine learning method is used as a model from SKLearn library to predict house price 
based on user provided criterias.

4. App Creation: Flask API has been used to create the user interactive application.

5. Deployment: Cloud application platform Heroku has been used to deploy the application.

## Used Language and Libraries:

* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib
* Flask
* sklearn
* gunicorn
